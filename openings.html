					    For prospective Ph.D. students, please apply through the <a href="https://cs.ucdavis.edu/graduate/our-programs/phd-degree">Ph.D. program</a> in the Department of Computer Science and <b>list me as a potential advisor</b> in your application. I will make sure to read your materials if you have listed me. If you would like to reach out to me, please use the email title <i>[PRSP PhD] + your current position and institute/organization</i>, so I can easily pay attention to the message. I will try to read all of the messages, however, I may not be able to reply to all of them. It is usually much easier to start a conversation from a short email with a concrete motivation.

					    For master students and outstanding undergrads already at UC Davis, if you are interested in participating in our research, you are welcome to contact me and my PhD students. When you do so, please make sure to briefly introduce your background and past experience related to NLP or ML. Note that we rarely host undergraduate students, usually no more than 3 at any time. However, for every undergraduate student who we decide to work with, we expect them to have all the necessary background for leading a research topic like a PhD student. We always target at helping undergraduate students publish nice works as lead authors at top venues in our field, and help them to obtain supports from undergraduate research awards and fellowships. The following are a few of our publications where the lead authors were undergraduate students:<br>
